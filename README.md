# Expo Camera Preview Freeze Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo Camera API where the preview freezes after taking a picture when using custom camera controls. The bug is intermittent and difficult to reproduce reliably.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Take several pictures using the custom controls in the app.  The freeze is not guaranteed to occur on every picture.

## Solution (cameraBugSolution.js)
The solution involves implementing a more robust error handling mechanism and potentially managing the camera lifecycle more carefully. The improved version includes cleanup and error checks which help prevent the preview from freezing.  It is still possible for edge case errors to occur.
